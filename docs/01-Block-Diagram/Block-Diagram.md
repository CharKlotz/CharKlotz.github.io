## Overview

This block diagram shows the light sensor subsystem and how it will connect to the teams system. The 5V regulated power supply will provide power to the op-amps aswell as the light sensor itself. A signal from the photodiode will be amplified by an op-amp, and then ran through the microcontrollers ADC to then be manipulated on the software side, before being sent back as an analog signal through the DAC to be read by the lighting subsytem.
