## Overview
This block diagram shows how the subsystem will interact with the rover wirelessly. It should allow the operator to give commands to the rover through the use of a display and buttons. This is a rough draft of how I have imagined the subsystem to be designed as our team is still unsure of how our systems will be interacting with each other.
