## Introduction

* This website serves as a way to document the creation and design of the Light Sensor subsytem for our team's automatic plant care system.

### Project Summary

* Our team is creating an automatic plant care system that automatically both waters and provides light to a plant. My portion of the project will be a light sensor with an amplified output to be sent to the lighting subsystem. Our team website can be found [here.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-106.github.io/ASU-EGR304-2025-F-106/)


### My Contribution

* To review the details of how the subsystem will work and connect with teammates, you can review it in the ["Block Diagram"](https://charklotz.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) section of the datasheet.

* To review the details on how components were selected for the subsystem, you can review it in the ["Component Selection"](https://charklotz.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) part of the datasheet.

* To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://charklotz.github.io/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.

* To review the schematic for the subsystem, you can review it in the ["Schematic"](https://charklotz.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) section of the datasheet.

* To review how the subsytem will be powered and, you can review it in the ["Power Budget"](https://charklotz.github.io/05-Power-Budget/New-md-file/) section of the datasheet.
